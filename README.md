# Project-1-Surprisals-and-RTs

This project involves analyzing surprisal values and reaction times (RTs) to predict reading time using different computational models.

## Description

The project is designed to compare the performance of an RNN model and an N-gram model in predicting mean reading time based on surprisal values. Surprisal is a measure of how unexpected a word is given its preceding context, which is often used in psycholinguistic research to study language processing.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model implementation)
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
